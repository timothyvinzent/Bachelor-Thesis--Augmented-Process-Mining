This reduces complex logic in the query.\n\n- **Data Completeness**: Ensure queries account for all relevant cases, including where certain events do not occur. Pre-compute and store necessary information in a new column if a query might miss cases or events due to filtering.\n\n- **Simplify Aggregations**: Generate columns to store intermediate results (like boolean columns or event counts) if a query requires aggregation, simplifying the final query.\n\n- **Minimize Logical Steps**: Pre-compute values requiring logic to reduce logical steps in queries, making them simpler and less error-prone.\n\n- **Readability and Maintainability**: Generate additional columns if a query becomes difficult to read and maintain due to their length. Simpler queries are easier to debug and less likely to contain logical errors.\n\n- **Risk of Direct Queries**: Only opt for a SQL query directly if it is safe and extremely unlikely to cause an error or logical mistake. Generating additional columns is always a safe bet with no negative consequences. We want to avoid failure as much as possible. Even if we have all the columns required to write a SQLite query, it could be safer to outsource any additional operations to an expert column generator.\n\n- **Missing Columns**: Generate additional columns if questions refer to columns not present in the database, even with close matches (e.g., \"amount_min\" or \"amount_last\" if only \"amount\" is present).\n\n# Steps\n\n1. Analyze the complexity of the potential query and identify any repeated calculations or intricate logic.\n2. Check if the potential query covers all relevant data cases, including unoccurring events.\n3. Consider the aggregation levels involved and simplify by pre-computing when necessary.\n4. Evaluate the logical steps required in the query and minimize them by generating additional columns.\n5. Assess the query for readability and maintenance concerns, opting for column generation if it enhances clarity.\n6. Verify the presence of necessary columns in the database; generate columns for missing ones referenced in the question.\n7. Critically evaluate the risk of directly answering with a SQL query and ensure it is only chosen when truly safe.\n\n# Output Format\n\nProvide a detailed explanation of your assessment followed by your decision: \"Generate Additional Columns\" or \"Answer with SQLite Query\".\n\n# Notes\n\n- If the required column is not present in the database, always opt for generating additional columns.\n- Consider the maintainability and readability of queries as a factor for decision-making.\n- Always provide a clear reasoning process before concluding to justify the decision effectively.\n- Be particularly cautious when deciding to opt for a direct SQL query and ensure all safety measures are thoroughly considered.\n- As a rule of thumb, anything related to money, balances and amounts should be handled by generating additional columns to avoid any potential errors and discrepancies (really important not to take any risk).",

      "instructions": "Your job is to determine whether an additional column should be generated or if a question should be directly answered using a SQLite query, follow these heuristics:\n\n1. Repeated Complex Calculations: If a potential query involves repeated complex calculations or aggregations, we generate additional columns to store these pre-computed values. \nThis reduces the need for complex logic in the query itself.\n\n2. Data Completeness: Potential queries must account for all relevant cases, including those where certain events do not occur. \nIf a potential query might miss cases due to filtering, we pre-compute and store the necessary information in a new column.\n\n3. Simplify Aggregations: If a potential query requires multiple levels of aggregation (multiple boolean or other conditions), we generate columns that store intermediate results (boolean columns, or event counts) to simplify the final query.\n\n4. Minimize Logical Steps: We reduce the number of logical steps in potential queries by pre-computing values that require complex logic, \nmaking the queries simpler and less error-prone.\n\n5. Readability and Maintainability: If a query becomes difficult to read and maintain due to its complexity, we generate additional columns. \nSimpler queries are easier to debug and less likely to contain logical errors.\n\nBy following these guidelines, we can ensure that our queries remain simple, maintainable, and accurate, reducing the likelihood of logical mistakes.\nIf it appears that a question is referring to columns that are not present in the database, additional columns should allways be generated to provide the necessary information.\nThis applies even to close matches (amount is present), but the questions is refering to amount_min or amount_last, which are not present in the database.",

The task is to count the number of distinct cases where 'add_penalty_count' is greater than or equal to 2. \n\nThe query should be constructed as follows:\n1.

Other columns are independent of cases and refer to events directly.\nYou can determine this, based on whether the column description mentions that all values are the same for a case or if the column is aggregated over a case.\nGrouping: When asked about questions independent of cases and you are using a column that is a case predicate, group by case to avoid counting an aggregated value multiple times.\nDo not forget about this for percentage calculations as well (using something like (DISTINCT case_concept_name) FILTER (WHERE col = 1) instead of not grouping by case first for case predicates).\nQuery Construction: Do not write the actual query. Instead, provide a detailed explanation of how to construct the query.\nAggregation: Aggregate data when necessary. Use subqueries and outer queries to limit the output size. Ensure the final result is a table that directly answers the question.\nSome questions might have multiple valid anwers(i.e finding case with highest value x, might have mutliple cases with the same highest value), be aware of this and consider LIMIT 10 instead of LIMIT 1 in such cases.",
