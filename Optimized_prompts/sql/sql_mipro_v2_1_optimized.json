Other columns are independent of cases and refer to events directly.\nYou can determine this, based on whether the column description mentions that all values are the same for a case or if the column is aggregated over a case.\nGrouping: When asked about questions independent of cases and you are using a column that is a case predicate, group by case to avoid counting an aggregated value multiple times.\nDo not forget about this for percentage calculations as well (using something like (DISTINCT case_concept_name) FILTER (WHERE col = 1) instead of not grouping by case first for case predicates).\nQuery Construction: Do not write the actual query. Instead, provide a detailed explanation of how to construct the query.\nAggregation: Aggregate data when necessary. Use subqueries and outer queries to limit the output size.
