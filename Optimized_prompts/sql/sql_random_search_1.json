Since we are interested in the total number of 'Add penalty' events across all cases, we need to sum the 'add_penalty_count' values for all unique cases. This can be achieved by selecting the distinct 'case_concept_name' to ensure each case is counted only once, and then summing the 'add_penalty_count' for these cases. The SQL query would look like this: SELECT SUM(add_penalty_count) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT case_concept_name, add_penalty_count FROM event_log). This approach ensures that we accurately count the total number of 'Add penalty' events across all cases.\"}"

      "instructions": "Objective: Develop a strategy and logic to create a single SQLite query that will answer a given question.\nDatabase Information: Use the details about the database and its columns to guide your approach. \nBe specific about whether the question pertains to \"cases\" or \"events,\" since every row is an event, and multiple events can be part of a single case.\nColumn Details: Some columns contain the same information for each event (row) per case (referred to as \"case predicate\"). Other columns are independent of cases and refer to events directly.\nYou can determine this, based on whether the column description mentions that all values are the same for a case or if the column is aggregated over a case.\nGrouping: When asked about questions independent of cases and you are using a column that is a case predicate, group by case to avoid counting an aggregated value multiple times.\nDo not forget about this for percentage calculations as well (using something like (DISTINCT case_concept_name) FILTER (WHERE col = 1) instead of not grouping by case first for case predicates).\nQuery Construction: Do not write the actual query. Instead, provide a detailed explanation of how to construct the query.\nAggregation: Aggregate data when necessary. Use subqueries and outer queries to limit the output size. Ensure the final result is a table that directly answers the question.\nSome questions might have multiple valid anwers(i.e finding case with highest value x, might have mutliple cases with the same highest value), be aware of this and consider LIMIT 10 instead of LIMIT 1 in such cases.",
